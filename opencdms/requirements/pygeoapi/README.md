## pygeoapi developer requirements

Here we keep track of additional dependencies that we may need to
install when working with [pygeoapi][pygeoapi].

The aim is to make these dependencies easy to install using
`opencdms install`.

See [docs.opencdms.org/developer/integrations/pygeoapi#requirements][require] for more information
